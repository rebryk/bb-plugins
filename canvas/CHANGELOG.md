# Changelog

Newest version first. [Releases](../README.md#releases) explains when a change
gets a new version. Each version is tagged `canvas/v<version>`.

## 0.1.12 (2026-10-01)

- Simplify gesture, draft, and import lifecycles with shared state updates and
  one tool definition for toolbar buttons and keyboard shortcuts.
- Share stroke rendering, image viewports, and resize handles across editing,
  cropping, and export.
- Use one capture operation and shared PNG preparation for browser captures
  and uploaded images, keeping stale requests from affecting newer captures.

## 0.1.11 (2026-10-01)

- Save image crops and deselect on an outside click without an extra toolbar.
  Keep Enter to apply, Escape to cancel, and expansion to the original image.
- Preserve crop changes when switching tools or inserting new elements.

## 0.1.10 (2026-10-01)

- Keep native text input responsive without replacing the editor's DOM text on
  each keystroke or restyling the surrounding thread.
- Reuse unchanged artwork and sticky layouts while typing, moving, and zooming.
  Fit long sticky text without repeatedly allocating and measuring wrapped lines.

## 0.1.9 (2026-10-01)

- Create square sticky notes with wrapped text that automatically fits inside.
  Resizing a note scales its text and padding together. Convert existing notes
  to squares while preserving their text, colors, and positions.
- Double-click an image with Select to crop it with eight handles and a movable
  frame. Apply, cancel, or reset the crop without modifying the source image;
  preserve crops in copies, Undo, agent reads, and PNG exports.
- Cut selected elements with Command/Ctrl+X and paste them through the existing
  clipboard workflow. Failed clipboard writes keep the original elements.

## 0.1.8 (2026-10-01)

- Order toolbar tools as Select, Sticky note, Text, Arrow, and Draw.

## 0.1.7 (2026-10-01)

- Start text and sticky notes with a compact single line that grows while
  typing. Only Enter starts a new line; deleting text shrinks its bounds.
- Use the same frame for selection and editing, with the sticky background
  following the draft. Preserve saved bounds when reopening an unchanged note.
- Keep the caret visible as an unwrapped line grows beyond the panel.

## 0.1.6 (2026-09-30)

- Add Arrow with color, stroke presets, Shift-constrained direction, and
  support for moving, copying, Undo, agent reads, and PNG export.
- Add editable yellow sticky notes with text formatting and matching exports.
- Fix double-click editing when pointer capture targets the canvas surface.
- Discard pencil and arrow clicks or jitter under three screen pixels while
  preserving short strokes, loops, and the final pointer-release position.

## 0.1.5 (2026-09-30)

- Draw and write directly on images without a modifier key; moving or resizing
  images requires Select. Text and strokes remain draggable in every tool.
- Keep images stationary when moving mixed selections with Draw or Text, and
  match their cursors and resize handles to the active tool.

## 0.1.4 (2026-09-30)

- Copy selected images, text, and drawings with Command/Ctrl+C and paste
  separate copies with Command/Ctrl+V, preserving styles and relative layout.
- Offset successive pasted groups, select the new copies, and undo each paste
  in one step. Support pasting between thread canvases with independent images.
- Keep native text editing and screenshot paste; let the Paste toolbar button
  insert copied elements too.

## 0.1.3 (2026-09-30)

- Show colors and three size presets directly in the first toolbar row, with
  dots for stroke widths and letters for text sizes.
- Drag existing elements with a mouse or pen in every tool. Hold Alt or Option
  to draw or write over them; touch keeps the selected tool's direct action.
- Keep the active tool after moving elements, show their selection handles,
  and avoid saving clicks that do not move anything.
- Apply text formatting to the current draft and keep focus while choosing
  colors and sizes.

## 0.1.2 (2026-09-30)

- Keep deleted images available for Undo for 24 hours after their last canvas
  element is removed, regardless of when the image was uploaded.
- Isolate recovery drafts between browser tabs while preserving reload recovery.
- Cancel active gestures before Delete, Undo, Redo, and tool changes so that
  releasing the pointer cannot restore an earlier preview.
- Capture embedded browser frames as whole blocks without passing clicks to
  their contents.

## 0.1.1 (2026-09-30)

- Keep the visible position when a drag loses pointer capture, and prevent
  native image dragging from interrupting canvas gestures.
- Save the final pointer position when releasing a moved or resized element.
- Put color and size controls at the end of the first toolbar row, with a
  popover for the color palette.

## 0.1.0 (2026-09-30)

- Add a canvas to each thread's right panel, with images, editable text,
  freehand drawing, Shift-constrained lines, selection, resize, undo, and zoom.
- Paste screenshots, drop or upload images, and capture a highlighted block
  from desktop BB's built-in browser.
- Save JSON documents and images per thread, with recovery for failed saves.
- Let agents read elements and view a PNG of the entire canvas; export PNGs
  from the panel or the CLI.
- Follow the active theme with compact San Francisco-style controls.
